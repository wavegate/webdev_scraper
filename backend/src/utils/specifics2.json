Candidates anywhere in the US are encouraged to apply. \n   About Us: \n   Ambience Healthcare's mission is to supercharge healthcare providers with AI superpowers. \n   The most painful part of a provider's day consists of hours of late-night administrative work, writing detailed documentation in the medical record for each of their visits. We're starting to see the consequences of this widespread documentation burden: providers are burning out and resigning from their careers in medicine at record rates. Until now, healthcare systems have been unable to find any solutions that work. \n   Ambience's flagship product, Ambience AutoScribe, is a fully automated AI medical scribe that captures the nuances of provider-patient conversation in real-time into comprehensive medical documentation within the EMR, so providers can focus on what matters most: caring for patients. The product is used by our providers every single day, and for the first time in years, they are able to get home on time for dinner without any documentation homework. Now, our providers refuse to practice without AutoScribe. \n   At Ambience, you'll be surrounded by an exceptional team of A-players who are kind, humble, curious, and deeply aligned with the core mission of improving the lives of providers and their patients, including: \n   \n   2nd time founders in healthcare who previously built a virtual care platform \n   the author of a leading deep learning textbook \n   co-founder of Cruise's ML platform team \n   co-founder of Rev.com's automated speech recognition team \n   former head of growth from a leading tech-enabled primary care group \n   \n  As we experience tremendous pull from the market for our product and on the heels of an oversubscribed Series A round (backed by a16z, Human Capital, and OpenAI, amongst others), we're actively growing the team across sales, marketing, product, engineering, clinical, and customer success functions.\n \n  The Role: \n As a Staff Frontend Software Engineer you will design, build, and maintain the core application that healthcare providers leverage every single day as they care for patients. \n  In the first 6 months, you'll help define and execute on the vision for how providers record visits, review & edit AI-generated documentation, and sync data into the electronic medical record.

Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft. \n  We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast—with more than 20 million users worldwide—and are excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide. \n  Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). \n  About The Role: \n  It's critical that Notion's website tells a clear story about the product and the value and transformation it makes possible for teams and companies. Given Notion's broad flexibility, it's also important that we tell a compelling story to specific audiences based on user persona, industry, geographic location, and more. Our website is the most important and versatile tool we have to personalize this experience for the millions of visitors it attracts every month, and route them to the right products and plans for them. \n  Success in this role looks like helping us build a dynamic, reliable, and instrumented website that captures people's attention, helps them truly understand the product's benefits, and increases conversion to paid plans. The role is on the marketing team and will partner closely with designers and developers who also sit on the team. \n  We’re at an exciting stage as a team where we’ve built out the foundational pieces of our marketing website. Our next focus is on refinement and taking the user experience to the next level. We’re looking for someone who cares deeply about quality and craft and wants to push the boundaries of what a modern marketing experience looks and feels like. \n  What You'll Achieve: \n \n  Partner with design and product marketing to build out the website in a way that tells a strong story to more of our audiences - i.e. Notion for Engineers, Notion for Marketers. \n  Drive the full stack development of our site: front-end, website infrastructure, data engineering, API integrations, logging, and more. \n  Ensure the full site is accessible, reliable, performant, instrumented, and optimized to increase conversions across multiple geographies. \n  Partner closely with growth to improve the performance of every page. \n  Build product experiences on the website so that people can visualize and get a deep understanding how it operates and the benefits it provides. \n  Pioneer external satellite sites, special projects, and experiments. \n  Help evolve our modern, component-based marketing architecture. Our site is statically generated using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and an intuitive headless CMS. \n \n Skills You'll Need to Bring: \n \n  8+ years of experience building scalable platforms. \n  Proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (we use TypeScript) and engineering fundamentals like Git. \n  Experience working with a front-end framework such as React or Vue (we use React + Next.js). \n  Familiarity with structured data and headless CMS platforms like Contentful. \n  Motivation to maximize business impact, and the ability to role up one's sleeves and get scrappy to make it happen. \n  Rigorous attention to detail across the full stack – someone who wants to make sure our website is a perfect ambassador for our brand on the front-end and technically sound on the server-side. \n  A good understanding of accessibility and a willingness to advocate for it. \n  Passionate about getting creative, reasoning from first principles, and not just building things because other companies like us have in past. You love to reach for the fresh and bold. \n  A brand mindset that gets excitement and joy out of telling stories in new ways and trying new things that haven't been seen before on a SaaS website ✨ \n  Energy around collaborating with artists, writers, other designers, as well as engineers. \n \n Nice to Haves: \n \n  An appreciation of design and understanding of what goes into crafting a great user experience. \n  \n We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

In practice, this means leveraging cloud delivery, modern tech stacks, machine learning, and hand-crafted native app experiences on all of our platforms. We aim to deliver a rock solid experience on the streaming basics, while cooking up next generation multi-screen and multi-user playback experiences. \n  Smart TVs at Philo \n  The small but growing Smart TV team at Philo is responsible for building our product experience on various Smart TV platforms, beginning with Samsung (Tizen) Smart TVs. The majority of minutes watched on the Philo service are on our \"10-foot\" platforms, and Smart TVs are an important and growing part of that ecosystem. Philo's first 10-foot platform was our Roku app, and in the years since we've expanded that to include Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV and Chromecast. The Samsung effort is our newest 10' platform and we're excited to add more native experiences to our service. \n  We're a small autonomous team building apps with high engagement, which collectively are responsible for a huge fraction of the billions of minutes watched on Philo each year. We are passionate about crafting the best possible UX to connect our users with the content they love, providing a seamless viewing experience while surprising them with new features and capabilities. We're highly focused on optimizing the 10-foot experience and you will directly contribute to that effort.

If you are a frontend developer looking for a new challenge, join Philo to help us build our Smart TV apps! No previous TV app experience is required - our Samsung app is built directly on modern web technologies (TypeScript + React), and even our Roku app is built on an in-house React BS framework (recently open sourced!) that leverages React and Redux architecture patterns. If you're a React hacker who cares deeply about writing quality code, using the latest tools and technologies to push the envelope of what's possible, then you share the same background as our entire Smart TV dev team and will ramp up quickly in our codebase.

You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck. \n  Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage to understand other perspectives and empathetically work towards consensus and compromise. \n  Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. \n  Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you put conscious effort into ensuring the people around you are successful through teaching, mentorship, and collaboration. \n  Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and the role our product plays in real people's lives.

If you interview with Byteboard, you won't be asked to write code on a whiteboard or solve coding brain teasers. Instead, we'll dive deep into your past work experiences and have you work through assessments focused on the skills you'll need to be successful day-to-day as an engineer at Byteboard. And, of course, we're our own customer; you'll get firsthand experience with the Byteboard product as you interview with us.\n \n   About the Team \n   We're product-oriented, quite scrappy when necessary, and sometimes are way too extra when making decks (among other things). \n  \n    At Byteboard, we uphold our Core Values in everything we do. Our team emphasizes our Core Values in the following ways:\n   \n   \n   Be Customer Obsessed - our customers drive our product and enable us to focus on delivering the most impact \n    Build Shared Success - building partnerships and working collaboratively with others to meet shared objectives \n   \n    ️ Be an Owner - holding self and others accountable to meet commitments\n    \n    Add the Cherry On Top - go the extra mile in our work and how we show up as a team, peers, and to our customers \n   \n  We are committed to building an equity-driven workplace with a team that is as intersectional as our users and investors.

Brilliant makes learning STEM fun, through problem solving and interactive explorations – from foundational math and science to cutting-edge computer science and professional topics.\nBrilliant helps over 12 million students, professionals, and lifelong learners around the world cultivate problem solving skills, build intuition, and master concepts rather than memorize them. To understand more about our approach, see our learning principles.\n*Application Note*\nWe're always excited to welcome and encourage anyone from non-traditional backgrounds to apply, so please, don't sweat the requirements lists too much! It's important to note that including a cover letter which details your interest in Brilliant and why you feel you'd be a great fit for this position will be required to be considered.\n*The Role*\nEngineers at Brilliant work closely with members of our Product, Design, and Content teams in cross-disciplinary pods to solve important problems for our learners. Currently, we're hiring product engineers for the User Motivation & Game Mechanics domain. Engineers working in this domain keep learners coming back for more through a series of user motivation systems that support structured, motivating progression through our content.\nInteractive education is in its infancy: we've only scratched the surface of what's possible with computer-based pedagogy. Our work helps people across Brilliant teach topics from vector calculus to neural networks in an interactive way. Come build the future of interactive learning with us!\nResponsibilities\n\n Bring new features from conception to completion, helping people around the world to learn more effectively by contributing code across our entire stack.\n Be mindful of the “big picture” from both a technical perspective and a business one, keeping your pod on track in terms of “building the right thing” and “building the thing right”.\n Exercise a high degree of autonomy and technical authority on a team that trusts you to do what's right for our users but is there to support you when you need it.\n Contribute to a culture of excellence within your pod, setting high standards for candor and mutual accountability, and striking a careful balance between velocity and quality.\n Advocate for initiatives that will improve developer experience for Brilliant's engineers and user experience for Brilliant's users.\n Frequently ask: How does this impact our learners?\n\nWho are you?\n\n You have at least 2 years of professional experience in software engineering.\n You got into programming because you’re motivated by solving users’ problems.\n You're capable of working across the stack, and you're most energized when owning feature implementations end-to-end.\n You enjoy solving technical challenges in a way simple enough for an intern to understand and build upon. You avoid introducing complex, novel, or \"clever\" solutions. You write code for humans, not for computers.\n You're excited to collaborate closely with talented engineers, product managers, and designers. You enjoy solving problems as a team, pair-programming, and sharing knowledge. You want to be a mentor and to be mentored.\n You have deep experience with a few languages and frameworks, and you know what you do and do not like about them. You believe in using the right tool for the job &mdash; even when it’s an unfamiliar one, and especially when it's a boring one. You stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and patterns, recognizing the differences between a game-changer and a passing fad.\n You have a favorite product and can articulate your perspective on what makes using it delightful. You often think about how the products you use could be better.\n\nSalary\n\n We use a systematic compensation framework. Salary scales are set each year for each job vertical, based on market data and company budget. Independently, managers level folks on their team, and those levels are mapped formulaically to our compensation scales.\n Additionally, we always make First and Best Offers &mdash; there is no negotiation (for new hires nor our existing teammates). This ensures that people are paid based on their expected contribution, rather than their negotiation skills.\n In San Francisco, NYC, and similar markets, the range for this role across the most likely levels for relevant candidates is $135-220k.\n We do apply a location-based adjustment in less competitive markets, typically 5-10%. Feel free to ask us about your particular location!\n\nOur Engineering Team\nOur engineers are extraordinary programmers without big egos. We love to share knowledge and support each other.

You will maintain awareness of the work being conducted by the rest of your team, and keep them apprised of what you're doing. Drive architectural discussions that ensure all the pieces fit together properly. \n  Take ownership. You will keep an eye out for tech debt, buggy edge cases, and other pain points; bring them to the attention of your team, and help establish best practices all of Engineering can use to get better at what we do. \n  Work efficiently and improve efficiency. You will suggest improvements to how we work, and help select good tools to expedite our work, so we can get better quality, efficiently. \n  Collaborate and communicate.

Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.\n \n\n"},{"index":577,"jobLink":"https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=b70a6cfdc19a10de&fccid=66403b30a2c0d89c&vjs=3","jobDescription":"\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      \n       \n        Remote, United States\n       \n       \n         Los Gatos, California\n       \n      \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       \n         Core Engineering\n       \n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n  \n   \n     Bring your passion for games and joy of partnership as we build our games developer experience.

If this sounds like the kind of place you’d like to be part of, please apply - we would love to hear from you!\n  \n  \n  \n    What does Hybrid mean at Hinge Health?\n  \n  \n    We believe that remote work and in-person work have their own advantages and disadvantages, and want to be able to leverage the best of both worlds. Some roles which require a greater degree of day-to-day collaboration will benefit from more in-person opportunities. That’s why we are encouraging employees near hubs to have in-person engagement and why we plan to localize our hiring strategy for certain teams to grow within designated hubs.\n  \n  \n  \n    About the Role\n  \n  \n    Application Principal Engineers guide and accelerate the evolution of Hinge Health’s mobile app. To improve member experience and outcomes, the mobile app must evolve toward a deeply personalized, “magical” experience that takes full advantage of device capabilities–including BLE input and ML edge computing. To increase the pace of innovation, the architecture of the mobile app must evolve to support dozens of independently contributing teams running hundreds of concurrent A/B tests with minimal coordination.\n  \n  \n    Principal engineers will glide between levels of abstraction to foster strong technical alignment, facilitate great technical decision making, and implement elegant solutions to the most complex and high-leverage technical problems. Their pragmatism, collaboration, thoughtfulness, and creative joy will shine through in every gesture, and disproportionately influence the technical culture of an engineering team that’s still doubling in size every year.\n  \n  \n  \n    We enjoy a continuous deployment DevOps culture, and take owner-operator pride in supporting our code in production with an on-call rotation. Rotations vary by team.\n  \n  \n  \n    #LI-KH2\n  \n  \n \n  \n   WHAT YOU’LL ACCOMPLISH\n   \n    \n      Continuous evolution of Hinge Health’s client mobile app to scale up to dozens of teams running hundreds of concurrent experiments.\n      Design and architecture of high-impact new customer experiences.\n      Scope and schedule of large projects are consistently accurate, due to rigorous de-risking and thoughtful planning.\n      Attentive mentorship and active skills training accelerates the professional development of technical leaders.\n      Strong alignment around well-defined principles and vision for change aligns several independent teams to make progress with little active coordination.\n      Increase Hinge Health’s voice in industry with technical articles and speaking engagements.\n      Increase the pace of high-quality innovation in one of the fastest growing startups shaping a new industry.\n      Be frequently moved to tears by your work, as you improve access to healthcare and transform real individual’s lives by offering relief from debilitating pain.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \n  \n   WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR\n   \n    \n      Front end mobile application development on a large, complex, top-quality consumer application using React Native.\n      Expertise in high performance computation, with an emphasis on profiling and bottleneck discovery, O(n)-driven intuitions, benchmarking, concurrency\n      Expertise in low-latency, highly resilient client-server architecture, including graceful degradation of features in low- or no-bandwidth modes.\n      Deep familiarity with the mobile app ecosystem, including testing, observing, deploying, and managing several concurrent versions in the field across a wide rage of consumer devices\n      Team-first, growth mindset, and ability to add leverage to every level of the org, from shipping code to shaping strategy with senior leadership.\n      Track record of effective project management, primarily devoted to early derisking, problem decomposition, and a strong vision that pulls the team toward the destination together\n      Experience with Agile techniques and tooling for rapid prototyping and experimentation\n      Education: Bachelor's in computer science, software engineering or related technical field\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \n  \n   BONUS POINTS\n   \n    \n      Experience with ML at the edge, inc computer vision, NLP, and diagnostic AI.\n      Expertise in Node.js, Android or iOS SDKs and native capabilities\n      Experience in IoT, smart home, AR/VR, or wearables (esp ones using BLE)\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \n  \n   WHAT YOU'LL LOVE ABOUT US\n   \n    \n      Inclusive healthcare and benefits: On top of comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, we offer employees and their family members help with gender-affirming care, tools for family and fertility planning, and travel reimbursements if healthcare isn’t available where you live.\n      Planning for the future: Start saving for the future with our traditional or roth 401k retirement plan options which include a 2% company match.\n      Modern life stipends: Manage your own learning and development budget, use the mental health to support therapy costs, and lifestyle stipends to cover your favorite wellness services, and work-from-home equipment.\n      Flexible vacation and paid time off: Employees have flexibility to choose when, how, and why they take time off to rest and recharge.

As organizations depend on cloud services, the Internet has become their defacto network connecting cloud applications to users. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform is like a 'Google maps of the Internet', providing the only collectively powered view of digital experiences end-to-end. We enable our customers made up of the world's largest and fastest-growing brands, to identify problems before they impact revenue, brand reputation, or employee productivity. \n  In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Cisco's Network Services Business Group, and is a foundational component of Cisco's growing Observability business. \n  What You'll Do \n  The goal of the Cloud and Enterprise Agent team is to provide a real-time network monitoring platform that measures, correlates, and visualizes synthetic data about global network conditions. This data allows our customers to gather performance metrics about network services and servers that they depend on and make informed decisions about how to take action should something go wrong. As a Senior Software Engineer on this team, you will be helping to address our two main challenges: keeping up with the ever-increasing amount of data gathered by our agents, and making this information more actionable for our customers. \n  Cloud and Enterprise Agents - Application Platform (CEA-AP) \n  Multi-metric views: This exciting project strives to migrate the frontend component of CEA views from a monolithic application to a new micro-frontend with quite a bit of added functionality to reduce the time for root cause analysis.

Some may think we're \"old\" (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do –you can't put us in a box! But \"Digital Transformation\" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) \n  Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. \n  So, you have colourful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us.\n  \n  We recognize that diverse teams make the strongest teams, and we encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. \n  Cisco COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements \n  The health and safety of Cisco's employees, customers, and partners is a top priority.
