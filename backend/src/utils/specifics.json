They realized they could integrate their knowledge into a credit card with smart points that did the work for you — so anyone can travel more without needing to become a points-obsessed enthusiast. \n Here they are now — tackling a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity to push the first real innovation in the true super-premium market since the inception of rewards credit cards. \n They're always looking for talented humans who are interested in pioneering this new era of credit card rewards. \n How We're Doing \n Our client was profitable 4 months after launching their private alpha product.

Across our core initiatives of Science and Education, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and advocacy, to progress in our mission of building an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone. \n   Our Values \n   We believe we can help build a future for everyone. \n   \n   We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress. \n   We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries. \n   Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day. \n   \n  Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. \n   CZI also supports multiple work options. Learn more about our philosophy and approach here.\n \n  The Opportunity \n About the Team \n  Recent advances in Single Cell Biology have created technologies capable of achieving the next grand challenge in biology: the comprehensive characterization of all human tissues at the cellular level. When complete, these references of tissue biology will enable researchers to unlock a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that cause disease at a molecular level which will in turn accelerate the discovery of new drugs to help cure and manage diseases. \n  The Single Cell Engineering team at CZI develops and builds open-source tools and web applications that enable the reuse of these references by a diverse set of scientific labs. Engineers work on a multidisciplinary team to not only build our products, but also to provide input on the roadmap, to design and lead projects, and to help drive best practices on the team. We value engineers who ask questions and who embrace changing product requirements as we adjust to match the fast-paced field of Single Cell Biology. We work very closely with our grants team to ensure that the tools we build and the grants we give are aligned in strategy to compound our impact.\n  \n  \n  About the Role \n  The Single Cell Engineering team is looking for a staff-level software engineer who gets excited about tackling full-stack data optimization challenges that ultimately lead to providing insights into the structure of their data. Our team works very closely with our users, who are scientists working at the cutting edge of computational and experimental biology working with data on tens of millions of cells to understand how genetic variants in cells impact disease risk, define drug toxicities, and discover better therapies. We believe that one of the greatest challenges is to present this vast data visually in a way that accelerates understanding and insights. \n  The problem we're working on, to which you will be a major contributor, is how to manage the very large data sets as described above, and to create an implementation that will present this data to the end-user scientist. While the specific visualization techniques might be understood, the method of handling the data to create those visualizations for efficient transport to a browser environment is challenging, especially at near-interactive speeds. \n  Applying deep knowledge of systems design, data structures, and algorithms, you will design and implement improvements to scale our interactive-speed visual data exploration tools that enable scientists to unlock insights from terabytes of high-dimensional, sparse datasets.\n  \n  \n  You will \n \n  Design, build, and optimize data structures and algorithms for our large-scale visualizations to facilitate the reuse of terabytes of single cell transcriptomics data, writing scalable, maintainable, testable systems. \n  Lead and facilitate discussions of design and software implementation towards decisions, influencing a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders. \n  Collaborate with Product Managers, Computational Biologists, Designers, and Software Engineers to deliver constant incremental value for scientists without compromising on software quality. \n  Have opportunities to learn about single cell technologies, though no prior experience is required! \n \n You have \n \n  5+ years of relevant software experience \n  Strong fundamentals in systems design, data structures, algorithms, and object oriented programming principles. \n  Past experience leading efforts to build new features or systems in web- or cloud-based applications. \n  Past experience doing performance optimization work especially spanning both the browser and server in the context of very large data. \n  Excellent written and verbal communication skills. \n  Enthusiasm to ramp up on technologies and learn a new science domain. \n  Experience working in a multidisciplinary environment (engineering, product, design).\n \n  \n  \n  #LI-Remote\n \n   CZI is committed to creating a more inclusive and diverse workplace.

We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. \n \n \n  About our Client\n   Our client is a serverless infrastructure company that has built a global state management platform for web developers. Their mission is to fundamentally change how software is built on the Internet and who gets to build it. They're looking for people who are passionate about improving the development experience for frontend engineers and who have strong opinions on what kinds of tools and workflows will remove barriers to getting things done. \n  The success of our client depends on having an extremely convenient, ergonomic and expressive developer interface. Their initial developer surface area includes libraries for web development in both React and vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript. They also execute user-defined functions in V8 containers server-side to process database queries and need to do so securely and efficiently. \n  \n  What excites them: \n  They are particularly interested in frontend developers with a passion both for developer experience and for the interaction between frontend libraries and backend infrastructure. An ideal candidate for the job would have deep experience with modern web frameworks and standards, packaging tools, and JavaScript library development. \n  There is tremendous scope for motivated frontend developers at the company both to develop their user surface areas, website and dashboard, as well as to influence their query model and developer experience. \n  \n  Qualifications: \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      \n       5+ years as a web platform, client infrastructure, or frontend infrastructure engineer experienced with TypeScript and well aware of the JavaScript ecosystem \n       Clear communication \n       Ability to create elegant, maintainable code \n       Tasteful API design skills \n       Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science \n       Frontend expert with at least understanding of BE plug-ins \n       3+ years experience \n       Startup (or hyper-growth) experience preferred \n      \n    \n  \n  \n   Location: \n  \n  \n   They view in-person time as essential to make quick strategic decisions, to build empathy and to form early team culture. But they also value that working from home allows productive heads-down execution, extra time with family, commute breaks, and schedule flexibility. So, they're currently following a three/two hybrid schedule: three days in the office and (optionally) two days at home. Therefore, interested candidates need to be either in the Bay Area or willing to relocate so they're able to attend their office in San Francisco, CA. Fully remote is not an option at this time.\n  \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n   Benefits: \n  \n  \n   They have competitive salaries, generous early-employee equity packages, excellent benefits, and lots of plants in the office! Most of all however, they're a group of friendly, highly-motivated people who love working together and hope that you'll love working with them too.\n  \n   \n  \n  \n   Base Salary Range: $165,000 to $225,000+\n  \n \n"},{"index":152,"jobLink":"https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=99e1b328a16e1afc&fccid=87f4318504cb0e3f&vjs=3","jobDescription":"\n\n Applicants must be currently authorized to work in the United States for any employer. \n Responsibilities: \n \n   Develop new user-facing features.\n   Build reusable code and libraries for future use\n   Ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs\n   Optimize application for maximum speed and scalability\n   Assure that all user input is validated before submitting to back-end\n   Collaborate with other team members and stakeholders\n  \n  Basic Qualifications: \n \n   2-3+ years of hands-on experience in large-scale (distributed) system architecture, complex software design, high scalability and availability, optimization, etc.\n   Extensive experience with UI technologies, defining visions/solutions and collaborating/driving to see them to completion\n   Strong analytical problem solving and decision-making skills\n   A degree in Computer Science (preferred) or related engineering field.

Here are some examples of projects we’ve released recently:\n \n \n \n   Intelligent Data Correlations help hardware engineers find the root cause of manufacturing issues in minutes, while it used to take days or weeks.\n \n \n   “High Mix” Tools\n   enable new categories of customers with diverse products to have a much smoother experience with Instrumental.\n \n \n   In-App Comments enable our users to collaborate quickly and ensure everyone shares context.\n \n  What’s awesome about this role is:\n \n   Build unique ML-powered features: We build tools that no one even realized were possible before we delivered them. Figuring out the data pipeline to help customers extract insight from their data is a fun challenge!\n   Great engineering experience: We keep our infrastructure-as-code. We have robust tests and monitoring. Most deployments can be done with one command. We keep meetings to a minimum. We stay Agile but don’t let process get in the way.\n   Learning & growth: Between working on features the world has never seen before, collaborating with a crazy smart team, diving deep into our Scala codebase, and the value we place on personal growth, we will help you expand your technical, product, and communication skills. Not to mention you will learn all kinds of crazy things about how physical things break.\n   Impact: This is a critical role to unlock high priority features on Instrumental’s roadmap, at a company whose mission is huge - to improve how physical things are made.\n \n  We’re looking for someone who:\n \n   Has written web app backends for at least 8 years\n   Is comfortable working in a JVM language like Java, Scala, Clojure, or Kotlin. Prior experience with functional programming is a bonus\n   Is comfortable working with SQL databases (we use PostgreSQL) - including things like designing schemas for scale and optimizing complex JOINs\n   Is familiar enough with web security to spot risks of common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc. in code reviews\n   Has experience tackling scaling pitfalls for web services, preferably with a JVM language, for example having to do with the JVM itself or with distributed systems\n   Is excited to be part of the product process and takes a user-oriented view of their work. We won’t ask you to be a PM or designer - you will spend most of your time coding or reviewing code - but we expect you to collaborate and take ownership when the specs inevitably don’t cover every detail\n   Is comfortable communicating clearly and often, because the problems we are solving can be complex\n   Is thorough in their work, internally motivated, and excited about Instrumental’s mission\n   Resonates with Instrumental’s cultural values: Play to Win, Be Helpful, and Work with Joy\n   Prior experience with manufacturing is not expected.\n \n \n   Culture & Benefits:\n \n \n   We’re a collaborative team that actively works to promote an inclusive environment, valuing passion and learning. We value transparency, which extends even to our interview process. It’s designed to build understanding of what it would be like to work together with empathy, not to put candidates on the spot.\n \n \n \n   To help Instrumentalists grow and thrive, we are also proud to offer competitive benefits.\n \n \n \n   All candidates must have an unrestricted right to work in the U.S.\n \n"},{"index":237,"jobLink":"https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=644f88a911f22811&fccid=b129647596d680d2&vjs=3","jobDescription":"\n \n  SHAREPOINT DEVELOPER/ADMINISTRATOR\n   \n   \n  San Jose/Evergreen Community College District\n   \n \n  Close/First Review Date: 08/21/2022\n  \n  \n Campus Location: District Office\n  \n  \n Position Description:\n  \n POSITION SUMMARY\n  \n  The SharePoint Developer/Administrator reports to the Director of Enterprise Application at the District Office.

At Waymo, we offer competitive compensation, bonus opportunities, equity, a generous 401(k) plan or regional retirement plans, 1-on-1 financial coaching, a 529 College Savings Plan and lots of other perks and employee discounts. \n  Flexibility and time off: Take the time you need to relax and recharge. Enjoy the flexibility to work from another location for four weeks per year. We support an on-site, hybrid work model and offer remote working opportunities, paid time off, Waymo recharge days, bereavement, sick, and parental leave. \n  Supporting families: When it comes to growing your family or caring for your loved ones, you have our full support.

We've built a marketplace for contractors to order that is growing 40% m/m and are now building a POS for suppliers for seven signed clients later this year with the eventual goal of becoming the de facto POS for building material suppliers!
